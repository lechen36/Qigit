    DataHandler is an abstract base class providing an interface for
    all subsequent (inherited) data handlers (both live and historic).

    The goal of a (derived) DataHandler object is to output a generated
    set of bars (OHLCVI) for each symbol requested. 

    This will replicate how a live strategy would function as current
    market data would be sent "down the pipe". Thus a historic and live
    system will be treated identically by the rest of the backtesting suite.
